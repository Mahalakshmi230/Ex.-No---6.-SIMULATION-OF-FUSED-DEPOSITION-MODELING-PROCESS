Step 1

EXPLANATION:
             In fused deposition modelling (FDM), the first step involves setting up the base and building platform. This is crucial for creating a stable foundation for the 3D printing process. The base is the initial layer of the object you’re printing and the build platform is the surface on which the entire object is constructed. 
             Ensuring proper alignment and calibration of the base and build platform is essential to achieve accurate and high quality prints. It typically involves adjusting settings such as the platform height and levelling to guarantee that the first layer adheres well to the build surface. This foundational step sets the stage for the successive layers to be accurately deposited during the printing process.
Step 2 

EXPLANATION:
          It usually consists of a motor driven gear mechanism. 
          The extruder nozzle is the opening through which the filament is deposited layer by layer to build the 3D object. Proper calibration of the extruder is essential for controlling the flow of filament, ensuring a consistent and accurate deposition during printing.
          Users often need to set parameters such as temperature and filament diameter to match the specific material being used. This step is crucial for achieving precise control over the extrusion process and ultimately influencing the quality of the final printed object. Adjusting these settings appropriately helps prevent issues like under extrusion or over extrusion, contributing to a successful 3D printing outcome.





Step 3

EXPLANATION:
          In the third step of the fused deposition modelling (FDM) process attention turns to the material spool. The material spool holds the filament, which is the raw material used for 3D printing. Filament is typically supplied in the form of a spool and it comes in various materials such as PLA, ABS,PETG, etc.

          Ensuring that the material spool is properly mounted and the filament is correctly fed into the extruder is crucial. This step involves loading the filament onto the spool holder of the 3D printer, guiding it through the extruder assembly and making sure it reaches the extruder nozzle without any obstructions.
            Proper handling of the material spool helps maintain a smooth and uninterrupted flow of filament during the printing process, preventing issues like jams or uneven extrusion. Additionally, users may need to configure settings related to the specific filament being used, such as temperature requirements and extrusion speeds, to optimise the printing conditions for the chosen material.          
Step 4

EXPLANATION:
           In the fourth step, the filament is added to the 3D printer. This involves manually loading the filament into the extruder system. Users typically feed the filament through a designated path, guiding it from the spool to the extruder. This step is crucial to ensure a continuous supply of filament during the printing process. Proper loading helps in avoiding interruptions and inconsistencies in the printed layers. Users may need to follow specific procedures provided by the 3D printer manufacturer, which often include tasks such as preheating the extruder to facilitate smooth filament insertion.Adding filament is a fundamental step in preparing the 3D printer for the actual printing job. It ensures that the extruder has the necessary material to build the object layer by layer according to the digital model.





Step 5

EXPLANATION:
          In the fifth step, after completing the necessary preparations with the base, extruder and filament the user initiates the printing by selecting the “Start process” option. This command signals the 3D printer to begin executing the instructions from the digital model.
           Once the process starts, the printer will progressively deposit layers of melted filament, building up the object according to the design. During this phase, it’s important to monitor the printer for any potential issues, such as layer adhesion problems or misalignment, to ensure a successful print.
            Starting the process marks the transition from the setup phase to the actual 3D printing and users may need to be attentive to the printer’s performance as it continues through the layers of the object until completion.         
Step 6

EXPLANATION:
           In the sixth step, after the 3D printer has completed building the object layer by layer, the user clicks on  “Stop Process” to halt the printing operation. This action signifies the end of the 3D printing task.
            Once the process is stopped, the user can examine the final product generated using the FDM process. It’s essential to allow the printed object some time to cool before handling it. The user can then carefully remove the object from the build platform. Inspecting the printed object is crucial at this stage to ensure that the dimensions, details and overall quality meet the desired specifications. If satisfied, the user can proceed with any additional post-processing steps, such as removing support structures or smoothing the surface to enhance the final appearance and functionality of the 3D printed item.
